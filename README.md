# Personal_Spotify_Import
After downloading your data from Spotify, Now import it to a database and explore.

You can download you personal data from Spotify by going to your account privacy page: https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/
From there you can make some setting changes and download :
*Account data (can take 5 days to gather)
*Your Extended streaming history (may take 30min to prepare for download)
*Technical log data (this can take 30days to get ready)

But what is in them? What information can you get from them? With this project you can find out.
